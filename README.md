# Three Iterative Methods on Linear Systems

Jacobi Method

Gauss-Seidel Method

Successive over Relaxation Method

# Eight Type of Matrices

random matrix

band diagonal matrix

diagonal matrix 

symmetric definite

symmetric indefinite

diagonal dominant matrix

z-matrix

q-matrix

# Code
To generate convergence graphs of all methods with matrix type "random" with size 100 for example:

python all_methods.py --mtype random --size 100

The graph will be save as random_100.png

# Next
The relevant matrices and their convergence graphs will be uploaded later.
